* Chose idea #2
* Whiteboarded architecture, UX, and some wireframes

## Ideas for a project (Brainstorming):


###1. Parent/Kids app - My Jobs 
* Navigable by child on tablet or phone (giant buttons)
* parent defined checkoff list of kid jobs, iconographic for pre-readers
* "all done" button registers completion, invites adult to inspect. 
* tracks completion rates for rewards
* jobs range from - brush teeth to clear table and takeout trash. 
	* Might also include "i woke up with a dry pull-up", or "i slept in my own bed all night"
	* might include behavioral accomplishments: I cleaned up at cleanup time without having to be told. 

###2. Parent/Kids app - My Day
* parent programs schedule, or pulls from google calendar
* child presented with simple, iconographic view of days and weeks activities
* empowers children to feel more control of their lives
* eases seperation anxiety, eases social anxiety at school. Eases generalized anxiety about not knowing what is going to happen each day
* allows child to anticipate upcoming events, birthdays, vacations, etc. 
* weather reports: enables child to dress appropriately for weather.
